            <p>Q: Why did I create this website?</p>
            <p>A: So I can impress anyone viewing this website as it would make me look more `pRoFesSional`.</p>
            <p>Q: When and why did you start a blog website?</p>
            <p>A: Around March of 2022, after I saw a video about the importance of a blog website.</p>
            <p>Q: Why dark theme only tho, light theme is cul too!</p>
            <p>A: There is code inside the CSS file that defines the light theme, but be careful tho, as it can cause blindness 101% of the time.</p>
            <p>Q: Why not use an SSG (Static Site Generator)?</p>
            <p>A: It's a hassle to set up, and besides, coding everything by hand is much more fun (And can be painful too)!</p>
            <p>Q: How many languages are used on this website?</p>
            <p>A: HTML, CSS (SCSS), JS (TS), JSON, Python (with more to come).</p>
